Express your feelings about the situation and provide examples of your own work and accomplishments. They may not be aware of the dynamics at play and may be able to provide guidance on how to navigate the situation.\nRemember, it is important to focus on your own growth and development, rather than getting caught up in comparison with others.

You could also consider discussing your concerns with a supervisor or HR representative to see if there are any opportunities for feedback or improvement in the recognition process.

She encountered strange characters and faced dangerous challenges, but she pressed on, fueled by her curiosity and the thrill of the unknown.\nFinally, after weeks of searching and following the clues, Sarah found herself standing in front of an old abandoned house at the edge of town. According to the map, the treasure was hidden somewhere within its walls.\nWith a deep breath and a pounding heart, Sarah entered the house, unsure of what she would find inside. The air was thick with dust and the creaking floorboards added to the eerie atmosphere.
